# Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)

A Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) is a report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient (Weldring and Smith, 2013). 
In other words, PROs provide reports from patients about their own health, quality of life or functional
status associated with a treatment or health care they have received, without any interpretations of the patient’s response by a clinician or doctor.

# Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) 

Patient Reported Outcome Measures or PROMs, are the tools or instruments used to
measure PROs, being often (patient) self-reported questionnaires
