# Patient Reported Outcome (PRO)

A Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) is a report of the status of a patient’s health condition that comes directly from the patient. 
In other words, PROs provide reports from patients about their own health, quality of life or functional
status associated with a treatment or health care they have received, without any interpretations of the patient’s response by a clinician or doctor.

# Patient Reported Outcome Measure (PROM) 

Patient Reported Outcome Measures or PROMs, are the tools or instruments used to measure PROs, being often (patient) self-reported questionnaires.
