Questionnaire (MCQ)

Abstract.  The Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ) was developed by Johnson, Foley, Suengas, and Raye 
(1988) to assess the characteristics of memories of external and internal origin, postulated in the source monitoring 
model (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993). The MCQ was translated into Spanish using a back-translation method. 
Psychometric properties of the translated MCQ were tested using responses collected from an experimental study sim-
ulating a forensic context. Ten police officers and 8 psychologists individually interviewed 240 university students who 
completed the MCQ after reporting what they had seen in a film. Half of the participants were asked to tell the truth, 
while the other half were asked to lie. The results have shown adequate psychometric properties of the Spanish MCQ 
items for the total sample and across experimental conditions. Cronbach’s alpha value was .79 for the total sample, .78 
for the honest condition, and .76 for the lie condition. Validity evidence of dimensionality supports that the factor struc-
ture of Spanish MCQ was equivalent to that proposed by the authors of the original version. Also, a two-factor ANOVA 
(video clip x condition) was performed to analyze experimental data. Neither interaction effects, F(236) = 1.189; p = .277, 
nor main effects were found to be significant between those asked to tell the truth and those asked to lie. These results 
demonstrate that the Spanish MCQ has adequate psychometric properties.

Johnson and Raye (1981) developed a reality moni-
toring model that characterizes the processes involved 
in deciding whether certain information is of external 
origin – meaning it has been obtained through percep-
tual processes – or of internal origin – generated by 
thought  or  imagination.  Later,  Johnson  et  al.  (1993) 
proposed the source monitoring model as an extension 
of the reality monitoring model, noting that remem-
bering involves not only distinguishing between the 
external/internal origin of the information, but also 
between  the  different  sources,  either  external  (e.g., 
whether a statement was made by this or that person) 
or internal. ”Source monitoring”, or “source memory”, 
involves making attributions about the origin of the 
information.

According  to  the  reality  monitoring  model  and 
various related empirical findings, compared to imag-
ined events, perceived events typically have more con-
textual, sensory and semantic information (Johnson & 
Raye, 1981), affective information (thoughts and feelings) 
(Hashtroudi,  Johnson,  &  Chrosniak,  1990;  Johnson  
et al., 1993; Suengas & Johnson, 1988) and supporting

information (Johnson et al., 1988; Suengas & Johnson, 
1988). Conversely, imagined events typically have more 
operational attributes (Johnson & Raye, 1981), later 
identified as cognitive operations (Hashtroudi et al., 
1990; Johnson et al., 1993).

To  confirm  some  of  the  source  monitoring  model 
assumptions, the authors developed an instrument that 
measures the characteristics of memories – the Memory 
Characteristics Questionnaire or MCQ. This questionnaire 
asks people to rate their phenomenal experience of both 
general memory characteristics, e.g., “My memory for  
this event is 1 (dim) to 7 (sharp/clear), and more specific 
attributes such as perceptual detail, temporal informa-
tion, and so on. The psychometric analysis of the orig-
inal MCQ (Suengas & Johnson, 1988) has shown there 
are five factors that distinguish memories of perceived 
events from memories of imagined ones: (1) Clarity 
(visual detail, vividness, event detail, comprehensibility 
of the order of events, and overall memories of the 
event);  (2)  Sensory  information  (sound,  smell,  and 
taste); (3) Contextual information (memory of location, 
spatial arrangement of objects, and spatial arrange-
ment of people); (4) Thoughts and feelings (memory of 
thoughts, memory of feelings, and how much the event 
reveals  about  oneself);  and  (5)  Intensity  of  feelings 
(how intense they were at the time of the event and 
how intense they are while remembering). On average, 
memories for perceived events should score higher than 
memories of imagined events in all these factors.

 J. Pegalajar et al,

The study carried out by Suengas and Johnson (1988) 
involved 144 university students of both sexes. After 
assessing both types of memory with a shortened form 
of the questionnaire, the authors compared the recol-
lection of subjects who had taken part in a series of 
activities (wrapping a package in a meeting with an 
Indian woman, having a cup of coffee with cookies, 
looking at photographs of two people, visiting an office 
at the Department of Psychology, and so on) with those 
of others who had received written information about 
the development of these same activities. In each group, 
an independent principal component factor analysis of 
the questionnaire measures showed that their structure 
was similar and matched the five factors mentioned 
above. The factor analysis did not yield a single factor 
related to cognitive operations or to supporting infor-
mation. Regarding information on feelings, there was a 
distinction between the affective quality itself and its 
intensity – both at the time of the event and at the time 
of the memory. The MCQ can be very useful in a foren-
sic  context,  given  that,  on  many  occasions  –  rape, 
sexual abuse, mobbing, bullying, emotional abuse, and 
many more –, there is no material evidence of the crime 
and legal decisions must be based on testimonial evi-
dence (Higueras, 2003).

The aim of our study was to adapt the MCQ to the 
Spanish population and test the psychometric prop-
erties of the Spanish MCQ. The MCQ data used to test 
the  psychometric  properties  was  obtained  from  an 
experimental study simulating a forensic context in 
which two groups of participants were compared sim-
ilarly to Suengas and Johnson’s (1988) study. In this 
case, the comparison was made between the responses 
of subjects who had been instructed to tell the truth in 
an interview and the responses of those who had been 
asked to lie about the facts.

Method

Participants

A  total  of  240  university  students  with  an  age  range 
between 18 and 41 years old (M = 21.55, SD = 3.18) 
were interviewed. Half of the participants were men 
(M = 21.63 years, SD = 3.72) and the other half were 
women (M = 21.48 years, SD = 2.54). There was no sig-
nificant difference between the average male age and 
the average female age, t(238) = 0.36, p = .731.

Materials

The original MCQ consists of 39 items assessing a wide 
range  of  memory  characteristics  (e.g.,  visual  detail, 
complexity, spatial and temporal information, thoughts 
and feelings) in order to differentiate the origin of the 
remembered event: perceived event versus imagined 

event (Suengas & Johnson, 1988). For all of the items 
on  the  MCQ,  participants  respond  by  checking  a 
number on a 7-point Likert-style scale (from dim to 
sharp/clear) for each item. Clearer memory events will 
score higher. The original MCQ version was adapted 
to Spanish based on International Test Commission 
Guidelines  (ITC,  2010),  specifically,  using  a  back-
translation method in the translation phase. The back-
translation  method  focuses  mainly  on  keeping  the 
“psychological meaning” in addition to producing a 
linguistically  correct  version  of  each  item  (van  de 
Vijver & Hambleton, 1996). The direct and back transla-
tions steps were carried out by members of the research 
team working independently. They were competent 
in both languages (English and Spanish), with a great 
expertise in memory research. Lastly, to adjudicate the 
final Spanish version of the MCQ, the comparison of 
both English versions (original and back translated) 
was  performed  in  several  meetings  in  which  items 
from both English versions were compared, item by 
item, to evaluate whether they measured the exact same 
behavior. As a result of these comparisons, no special 
difficulties  were  identified  in  adjudicating  the  final 
Spanish version of the MCQ items. However, during 
the adjudication phase, it was decided that original 
items number 23 (“The overall tone of the memory is 
negative/positive”),  and  number  28  (“Feelings  at  the 
time were positive/negative”), of the source question-
naire should be broken down into items, 23–24 and 
30–31 respectively. This was decided based on current 
theories on affect suggesting that positive and negative 
feelings are independent (Cacioppo & Gardner, 1999). 
The final version of the Spanish MCQ based on the 
psychometrics obtained for the total sample is presented 
in the Annex.

Procedure

The data collection for the MCQ was performed under 
the framework of a broader research on the source-
monitoring model and its possible application to the 
credibility of testimony. The interviewees arrived at a 
laboratory of the School of Psychology after having 
been invited to participate in a memory experiment. 
Subjects were informed that they would see a video 
clip, and then receive instructions about the following 
tasks.

Half  of  the  participants  randomly  selected  were 
shown a 2-minute clip of the film Thelma and Louise, 
directed by Ridley Scott (Scott & Polk, 1991), which 
depicted the rape of a woman by a man. The clip was 
dubbed  into  Spanish.  The  clip  shows  a  man  and  a 
woman about 30 years old strolling at night in a public 
parking lot while talking cheerfully. Suddenly, the man 
tries to hug and kiss the woman to which she refuses.

Then, the woman slaps him and he tries to rape her. 
When  the  woman  asks  her  friend  for  help,  the  clip 
ends. The other half of participants were shown a frag-
ment of the same length of the film Bajo la Piel, directed 
by Francisco Lombardi (Herrero & Lombardi, 1996), 
showing consensual sex between a man and a woman. 
Participants saw the original Spanish version of the 
fragment. Directly after viewing the clip, within each 
group, subjects randomly received written instructions 
to  provide  an  account  of  what  they  had  seen  in  an 
interview, either telling the truth – Honest condition – 
or lying – Lie condition –. In the latter condition, par-
ticipants who were shown the film directed by Ridley 
Scott  were  instructed  to  explain  that  they  had  seen 
consensual sex, whereas those who had seen the film 
directed by Lombardi were instructed to say that they 
had seen a rape. Participants were asked not to make 
any changes in the rest of the material they had seen. 
After the interview, all participants were administered 
the  Spanish  version  of  the  MCQ.  Participation  was 
voluntary  and  students  received  course  credits  in 
exchange for their participation. Confidential use of data 
was guaranteed. The group of interviewers was com-
posed of eight psychologists (6 females and 2 males), 
and 10 police officers (9 males and 1 female).

Analysis

First, mean (M), standard deviation (SD), and the Pearson 
item-total  correlations  taken  for  the  discrimination 
index (DI) of each item of the Spanish MCQ were cal-
culated for the total sample. Cronbach’s alpha coefficient 
was also calculated to assess the internal consistency of 
responses to each question in the questionnaire. In gen-
eral, the criteria used to assess an item’s performance 
were: (a) items with a discrimination index under .20 
were eliminated; and (b) items had to contribute posi-
tively  to  the  internal  consistency  of  questionnaire 
(Kline, 1994). The relevance of items for the content 
validity of the questionnaire was also considered when 
items failed to meet both criteria.

The authors of the original version of the MCQ devel-
oped a theoretical model of the factor structure of the 
measuring instrument. However, this model did not 
include  all  the  items  of  the  original  version  of  the 
MCQ, only a subset of them (Suengas & Johnson, 1988). 
Therefore, the factor structure analysis and gathering 
of validity evidence were carried out in two phases. 
First, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was per-
formed using all the items in the Spanish version of the 
MCQ. The aim of this analysis was to obtain evidence 
of the factor structure of the questionnaire on a Spanish 
sample, given that such information was not available. 
Secondly, a Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) was 
performed using only the items of the Spanish version

of the MCQ that matched the items of the original ver-
sion included by Suengas and Johnson (1988) in the 
original theoretical model. This analysis was expected 
to obtain evidence of fit between the Spanish version of 
the MCQ and the original theoretical model proposed 
by Suengas and Johnson (1988). SPSS software (version 
14.0) was used to perform the EFA and LISREL 8 soft-
ware, version 8.8 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 2007) was used 
to perform the CFA.

Two items of the preliminary Spanish version of the 
MCQ were not included in any of the analyses per-
formed because in the procedure used in the adapta-
tion of the MCQ, participants watched the films at the 
same time and were instructed not to talk about the 
film they had watched until the end of the experiment. 
Such items were item 40, “Talked about it” and item 41, 
“About when did this event happen?” Thus, the analyses 
were performed on an initial set of 39 items.

Once the Spanish MCQ version was developed based 
on psychometrics for the total sample, psychometrics 
for the two experimental conditions were obtained. 
Cronbach’s alpha coefficients and factor structures by 
EFA were analyzed comparing MCQ responses between 
participants asked to tell the truth and those asked to 
lie. Feldt’s W statistic (Feldt, 1969) was calculated to 
test the null hypothesis that Cronbach’s alpha coeffi-
cients for the two experimental conditions are equal. 
Finally, a two-factor ANOVA (video clip x condition), 
was performed to analyze the experimental data. F sta-
tistics were used to test the null hypothesis about main 
effects  and  interactions  between  both  experimental 
conditions. SPSS 21 software was used to perform all 
these analyses.

Results

Firstly,  the  psychometric  properties  of  the  Spanish 
MCQ for the total sample are reported, followed by the 
results for the two experimental conditions. Finally, 
the results for the differences between MCQ scores for 
the experiment are also presented.

MCQ psychometrics for the total sample

Statistical analyses of items

Results  from  the  initial  group  of  items  for  the  total 
sample showed inadequate properties in three of them. 
These  items  were  item  24  (“The  overall  tone  of  the 
memory is”), M = 2.82, SD = 1.90, DI = –.92; item 30 
(“Feelings at the time were”), M = 2.99, SD = 1.75, DI = –.14 
and  item  38  (“Do  you  have  any  doubts  about  the  
accuracy of your memory for this event?”), M = 2.66, 
SD = 1.75, DI = –.13. All these items were removed 
from the final Spanish MCQ, as they showed a nega-
tive or null relation with the rest of the items in the

questionnaire, and their contributions to the Cronbach’s 
alpha coefficient were also negative.

After removing such items, the Spanish MCQ was 
composed of 36 items. All the analyses were performed 
on this new group of items.

The internal consistency of the MCQ, estimated by 
Cronbach’s alpha, was .79. DI values of the Spanish 
MCQ items ranged from .12 to .49. Only DI values for 
item 2 and item 6 were lower than .12. It is important to 
point out that item 6 (“Do you remember tactile sensa-
tions?”)  had  the  lowest  DI.  The  most  likely  reason  is 
that a film was used as the event to remember, and, 
obviously,  a  film  cannot  involve  tactile  sensations. 
Nevertheless, both, item 2 and item 6 were maintained 
in the Spanish version because they capture important 
elements in the clarity and sensory information factors. 
The rest of items exhibited adequate indexes, given the 
complexity of the scale, for instance, the use of different 
evaluation dimensions across items.

Factor structure and validity evidence

Regarding  the  EFA,  the  Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin  value, 
KMO  =  .752  and  Bartlett’s  Test  of  Sphericity  value, 
χ2(465) = 2530.79, p <.001, illustrate the sampling ade-
quacy and the strong relationship between variables. 
After this, principal component analyses with Varimax 
rotation were performed on all 36 items included in the 
Spanish MCQ version. In order to determine the opti-
mal number of factors, three criteria established by 
Scholz, Gutiérrez-Doña, Sud, and Schwarzer (2002) were 
combined: (a) the eigenvalues of the factors should be 
greater than 1.00; (b) the multifactor solution should 
contain at least three loadings for each factor, that is, 
additional factors with only two or less loadings were 
unacceptable;  and  (c)  each  factor  should  explain  at 
least 5% of the variance.

The principal component analyses revealed 11 factors 
with eigenvalues greater than 1.00. Nevertheless, only 
5 factors had at least three loadings and only these 5 
factors explained more than 5% of the total variance. 
The analysis was repeated specifying a 5-factor solution. 
The factor loadings of Item 11 (“Order of events is…”); 
item 12 (“Story line is…”); item 14 (“General setting 
is…”);  item  22  (“The  event  seems…”),  and  item  34 
(“This  memory  reveals  or  says  about  me…”),  were 
below  .30  and  they  did  not  group  in  a  meaningful 
factor. Thus, such items were removed from the final 
Spanish MCQ version.

After  this  last  change,  the  principal  component 
analyses were performed one more time, specifying 
a  5-factor  solution  and  using  31  items  (see Annex). 
The factor loading matrix is shown in Table 1.

The five factors identified explained 48.94% of the 
variance. The first factor –Clarity– had an eigenvalue

of 5.05, explained 16.29% of the total variance and was 
composed of items 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 28 
of the present adaptation. It informs about the visual 
aspects of the memory – items 1, 2, 3, 8, 9, 10, and 28 – 
and the spatial location of stimuli – items 13, 15, and 
16 – and is therefore a visual-spatial factor. The Clarity 
factor in the present version is equivalent to Clarity 
(Factor 1) – without including item 2 – and Contextual 
Information (Factor 2) factors in Suengas and Johnson’s 
(1988) version.

The second factor – Emotional involvement – had an 
eigenvalue of 3.76 and explained 12.12% of the total 
variance. It is composed of items 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25 
and 26. The factor is defined by aspects related to the 
intensity of feelings, the negative valence of memories 
and the implications/consequences of the event for the 
subject. It is a compound factor that partly includes the

Emotional Intensity factor (Factor 5) – items 20 and 26 – 
of the original model.

A third factor with an eigenvalue of 2.52 explained 
8.12% of the total variance and was composed of items 
14, 15, 16, 17 and 18, which refer to the amount of tem-
poral information of the memory. Hence, it was called 
Temporal Information. There is no equivalent dimension 
in Suengas and Johnson’s (1988) model.

Items 24, 27, 29, 30 and 31 loaded on a factor called 
Thoughts and Feelings, which explained 6.41% of the 
total variance and had an eigenvalue of 1.99. This factor 
is also compound like the first two factors. It encom-
passes both the qualitative aspects of the thoughts and 
feelings  during  the  event  and  what  the  model  calls 
“supporting memories”, that is, what happened before 
and  after  the  event.  The  original  model  proposes  a 
Factor 4, also called Thoughts and Feelings but defined 
only by items 24, 27 and 29.

Finally, a fifth factor – Sensory Information – had an 
eigenvalue of 1.86 and explained 6% of the total vari-
ance. It accounts for all the information remembered 
with regard to the senses, except visual aspects – items 
4, 5, 6 and 7 –. Suengas and Johnson (1988) proposed 
an identical factor, although it was second in its explan-
atory importance.

In the present study, confirmatory factor analyses was 
used to check whether the data distribution obtained 
by the MCQ Spanish version matched the original factor 
structure proposed by Suengas and Johnson (1988). 
This model did not include all MCQ items to test the 
fit of the Spanish MCQ to the original model. Table 2 
shows the Spanish MCQ items which were included in 
the original theoretical model (Suengas & Johnson, 1988).
As  can  be  seen  in  Table  2,  Suengas  and  Johnson 
(1988) established a theoretical model composed by 
five factors: Clarity, Sensory Information, Temporal 
(contextual) Information, Thoughts and Feelings and 
Intensity of Feelings.

The Weighted Least Squared (WLS) method was used 
to estimate ordinal data, as recommended by Jöreskog 
and Sörbom (1993). In a previous step, covariance matri-
ces and asymptotic covariance matrices were obtained

by using Prelis software, version 8.8 (Jöreskog & Sörbom, 
2007). The following standard indexes were considered 
as indicators of good fit: the root mean square error of 
approximation (RMSEA) should not exceed .08; the 
goodness of fit index (GFI), the non-normed fit index 
(NNFI), and the comparative fit index (CFI) indices 
should reach values above .90, and adjusted goodness 
of fit index (AGFI) index should reach values above .80. 
Table 3 shows factor loadings of 16 items included in 
the CFA and the indices mentioned (original item 34 
was not included because it did not exhibit adequate 
loadings in the EFA).

As Table 3 illustrates, on the one hand, as a negative 
point, the RMSEA value exceeded .08, 90% CI [.10, .12], 
and the chi-square value was significant, χ2(94) = 377.84, 
p < .001. However, this index is totally dependent on 
sample size (Bentler & Bonnet, 1980). On the other hand, 
the values of goodness-of-fit statistics were optimal. 
The NNFI, CFI, GFI and AGFI had values higher than 
established criteria. These results are considered to be 
adequate. Thus, the score distribution of these MCQ 
Spanish version items matched the theoretical model 
proposed by Suengas and Johnson (1988).

With respect to factor loadings, all factor loadings 
were significant and ranged from .34 to .94, MFL = .80, 
except item 5, whose factor loading was higher than one.

This  effect  could  be  caused  by  the  RMSEA  value. 
Moreover,  it  is  important  to  note  that  item  5,

Internal consistency analyses were performed for each 
experimental condition. Cronbach’s alpha of the Honest 
condition was .78, slightly higher than that of the Lie 
condition, which was .76. However, Feldt’s W (Feldt, 
1969) did not reveal a significant difference (w = .19, 
p =.650).

The  KMO  values  for  both  conditions,  Honest: 
KMO = .678 and Lie: KMO = .691, and Bartlett’s Test of 
Sphericity values, Honest: χ2(465) = 1358,932, p < .001; 
Lie: χ2(465) = 1597,647, p < .001, illustrate the sampling 
adequacy  for  EFA.  After  this,  principal  component 
analyses  with  Varimax  rotation  were  performed  on 
all  36  items  included  in  the  Spanish  MCQ  version. 
The  5-factor  solution  explained  49.13%  and  52.11% 
of the variance for the Honest and the Lie conditions 
respectively. The factor loading matrix for both condi-
tions is shown in Table 4.

In general terms, factor loadings are very similar in 
both experimental conditions and to the factor structure 
found for the total sample. For example, distributions 
of all factor loadings of Factor 3 items (“Temporal infor-
mation in memory”), for both conditions are equal to 
those found in total sample and above .54, but item 
18 whose factor loading in Factor 2 is slightly above 
the  criteria.  On  the  other  hand,  3  out  of  4  items  of 
Factor 5 (“Sensory information”), show also relevant 
factor loadings in Factor 4 (“Thought and feelings”) for 
Lie condition.

A  two-factor ANOVA  (clip  x  condition)  was  per-
formed to analyze experimental data. Total scores from 
the Spanish MCQ were set as the dependent variable. 
Interaction was not significant, F(236) = 1.189; p = .277, 
neither were the main effects: film, F(1) = 24.727; p = .126, 
and condition, F(1) = 1.308; p = .457. When both con-
ditions were compared regardless of the film, no sig-
nificant differences were found in mean scores between 
participants asked to tell the true and those asked to lie, 
t(238) = –2.783; p = .240.

Discussion

The aim of study was to develop and test psychometric 
properties of the Spanish MCQ. First, a careful transla-
tion was performed using the back-translation method 
and attention was paid to ITC guidelines. The final 
version of the Spanish MCQ is based on psychomet-
rics obtained from MCQ responses in an experiment. 
Experimental data allow the researcher to obtain valid-
ity evidence in a way that satisfies the current views

on validity theory, especially source of validity evidence 
based  on  relationships  with  other  variables  and  on 
internal structure (AERA, APA, NCME, 1999; Sireci & 
Padilla, 2014). Psychometric and validity evidence for 
the total sample and for both experimental conditions 
support the adequacy of the Spanish MCQ.

However, it must be highlighted that the structure of 
the Spanish MCQ is not exactly the same as that of the 
original English version. The discriminative analysis of 
the items shows inadequate psychometric properties 
in 3 items (24, 30 and 38) that were removed from the 
final version of the Spanish MCQ. Items 24 and 30 are 
particularly important. They refer to positive affect. 
Yet, items 19 and 25, which assessed negative affect, 
showed adequate discrimination indices. No explanation

has been found for these results. It is possible that, 
although  a  priori,  the  emotional  valence  of  the  two 
film clips seen by participants was different, partici-
pants tended to assess them with a negative valence. 
This may have been influenced by the sexual content 
of both stimuli. In any case, future studies will have 
to  determine  whether  the  emotional  characteristics 
of  memories  assessed  with  procedures  such  as  the 
MCQ  are  more  likely  to  be  assessed  in  bipolar  or 
unipolar terms.

Moreover,  the  factor  structure  of  the  MCQ  in  the 
Spanish sample shows some characteristics that are 
not observed in the original version. Perhaps, this is 
influenced by the fact that the present principal com-
ponent analysis was performed with 31 items, whereas 
Suengas and Johnson (1988) used 30 items. Therefore, 
the variables measured differ between both studies. 
This may explain the fact that the Temporal Information 
factor  does  not  appear  in  the  original  study  (items 
15–18 refer clearly to this). Furthermore, the Emotional 
Involvement factor of the present adaptation is more 
complex than the original Emotional Intensity factor 
because it includes the memory of the consequences 
that the event could have had for the subject. This may 
have been influenced by the fact that items 22 and 23 
were not measured. Something similar has happened 
with other adaptations of the MCQ to various cultural 
contexts. For example, the adaptation to the German 
language by Sporer and Kuepper (1994) included 35 
items and obtained 8 factors in an EFA. In a Japanese 
adaptation, Takahashi and Shimizu (2007) obtained 
8 factors from 38 items. In summary, future research 
should use the Spanish version of the revised MCQ 
with Spanish samples due to the adequate psychomet-
ric properties shown in this study.

Other aspects to highlight in the present adaptation 
refer to the explanatory importance of the Clarity factor, 
which matches the original model. However, in the 
present adaptation it is defined by the visual and spa-
tial aspects of the memory, whereas it is exclusively 
visual in Suengas and Johnson’s version. This is con-
sistent with the predictions of the model, since it is 
postulated that the memory of what was perceived is 
characterized by the number of details of the stimuli 
and  their  spatial  location.  The  same  applies  to  the 
Sensory Information factor. In addition, the compound 
structure  of  the  present  Clarity  factor  explains  the 
absence of the Contextual – spatial – factor of the orig-
inal model in the Spanish sample.

It  is  also  worth  mentioning  the  different  order  
of  some  factors  in  both  studies.  For  example,  the 
Sensory Information factor is second in explanatory 
importance in the original study but fifth in the pre-
sent study; the second factor in the present study – 
Emotional Involvement – has an equivalence in the 

Spanish Adaptation of the MCQ

fifth  factor  –  Emotional  Intensity  –  in  Suengas  and 
Johnson’s  study,  although  in  the  present  study  the 
factor includes other aspects apart from mere emo-
tional quantification. It seems as if there has been a 
permutation in the order of both factors. This may be 
related to the differences in the manipulations of both 
studies. In the present study, participants watched film 
clips  showing  a  rape  or  consenting  sex  and  half  of 
them were instructed to lie about this in the interview. 
However, subjects in the study by Suengas and Johnson 
(1988)  participated  in  activities  that  included  visits 
to various places, introductions to several people and 
food and drink (cookies, soda, and coffee). It is pos-
sible that the conditions of the present study are more 
prone to eliciting emotional activation. To the extent to 
which such effect was provoked, the data analyzed in 
this study could have been obtained in similar condi-
tions to which victims or witness of serious offense 
experience. These conditions could lead to research 
on whether a high emotional activation increases the 
number of memories that victims or witness remember. 
This could be very useful in forensic contexts.

The results of the present study have also shown that 
the original model proposed by Suengas and Johnson 
(1988) is viable in a Spanish sample, as shown by the 
CFA. However, we consider that it is a restrictive model, 
since it does not include some aspects present in the 
context  of  Source  Monitoring  and  that  the  present 
exploratory analysis has highlighted. Such aspects are 
Temporal  Information,  Emotional  Involvement  and 
Supporting Information. The present study should be 
considered as a first step in the Spanish adaptation of 
the MCQ. Future studies about the credibility of testi-
mony should determine whether a broader theoretical 
model including such aspects would adjust better to 
the data.

In conclusion, the MCQ approach provides a useful, 
replicable way of exploring the nature of the subjective 
experience of remembering (Johnson et al., 1988) and 
of clarifying our understanding of the relevant features 
of  memory.  Furthermore,  the  general  source  moni-
toring framework and the MCQ procedure provide a 
systematic approach not only for studying the differ-
ences in true and false accounts of memories reported 
in good faith, but also for exploring the differences that 
appear between the accounts of subjects attempting to 
tell the truth and subjects attempting to lie about what 
they have seen.
