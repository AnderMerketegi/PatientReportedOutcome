This study aimed to determine the factors that predict anosognosia in patients with Alzheimers disease (AD) and to examine the effect of anosognosia on patient and caregiver perceptions of the patients quality of life (QoL-p), using a cross-sectional design with 164 patients and their caregivers 3, p < 0 3233/JAD-2012-121360 IOS Press 1105 Clinical Differences in Patients with Alzheimers Disease According to the Presence or Absence of Anosognosia: Implications for Perceived Quality of Life Josep L The degree of anosognosia increased in line with GDS stage (F (2,161) = 41 17, p < 0 001), decits in ADL (OR = 0 A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that predict anosognosia, while a linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors associated with QoL-AD Instruments of measurement included Anosognosia Questionnaire- Dementia, Geriatric Depression Scale, Quality of Life in AD (QoL-AD), Disability Assessment for Dementia, Neuropsychiatric Inventory, and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) In the binary regression analysis, the variables that predicted anosognosia were more neuropsychiatric symptoms (OR = 1 Anosognosia was associated with greater caregiver burden and a greater discrepancy between patient and caregiver ratings of QoL-p 001) explained 33% and 10% of the variance in QoL-AD, respectively The concept of anosognosia refers to a lack of aware- ness regarding the difculties or decits associated with an illness, and it has long been recognized as an important feature of Alzheimers disease (AD) [1] 001) and greater anosognosia ((cid:1) = 0 With regards to QoL-p, the multiple linear regression analysis for patients (r2 = 0 94, p < 0 001), less depression (OR = 0 Journal of Alzheimers Disease 33 (2013) 11051116 DOI 10 / Anosognosia and Quality of Life Specically, the person with AD may show a lack of awareness regarding impairments related to activities of daily living (ADL) [2] or their neuropsychological decits, especially memory [3, 4] A key contributor to this variability is the wide range of methods used to measure anosognosia, which include the use of ques- tionnaires to compare patient and caregiver ratings [10], the clinical judgment of professionals in relation to an anosognosia scale [11], and the administration of neuropsychological tests [3] 88, 95% CI: 0 Estimates of the prevalence of anosognosia in AD vary widely between 20% [10] and 80% [11] and illustrates the enormous complexity and heterogene- ity of the condition [1215] Greater anosognosia was associated with better perceived QoL-p, especially in advanced GDS stages Anosognosia can have important implications as patients underestimate their limitations in relation to quality of life [57] and are more prone to engage in dangerous behaviors [8] 001), and older age (OR = 1 One key question is whether anosognosia forms part of the general characteristics of the disease process or whether it is a specic syndrome that is more common in certain patients
