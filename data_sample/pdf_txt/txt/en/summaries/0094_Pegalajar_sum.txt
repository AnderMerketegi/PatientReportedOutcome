The Memory Characteristics Questionnaire (MCQ) was developed by Johnson, Foley, Suengas, and Raye  (1988) to assess the characteristics of memories of external and internal origin, postulated in the source monitoring  model (Johnson, Hashtroudi, & Lindsay, 1993) The results have shown adequate psychometric properties of the Spanish MCQ  items for the total sample and across experimental conditions Psychometric properties of the translated MCQ were tested using responses collected from an experimental study sim- ulating a forensic context Spanish Adaptation of the Memory Characteristics  Questionnaire (MCQ) Joaqun Pegalajar, Alberto Acosta, Miguel Castillo, Lorenzo Higueras and Jos-Luis Padilla Universidad de Granada (Spain) Abstract Half of the participants were asked to tell the truth,  while the other half were asked to lie The MCQ was translated into Spanish using a back-translation method Validity evidence of dimensionality supports that the factor struc- ture of Spanish MCQ was equivalent to that proposed by the authors of the original version Ten police officers and 8 psychologists individually interviewed 240 university students who  completed the MCQ after reporting what they had seen in a film 78  for the honest condition, and  79 for the total sample,  Johnson and Raye (1981) developed a reality moni- toring model that characterizes the processes involved  in deciding whether certain information is of external  origin  meaning it has been obtained through percep- tual processes  or of internal origin  generated by  thought  or  imagination 277,  nor main effects were found to be significant between those asked to tell the truth and those asked to lie These results  demonstrate that the Spanish MCQ has adequate psychometric properties Source monitoring, or source memory,  involves making attributions about the origin of the  information 76 for the lie condition The aim of our study was to adapt the MCQ to the  Spanish population and test the psychometric prop- erties of the Spanish MCQ (1993)  proposed the source monitoring model as an extension  of the reality monitoring model, noting that remem- bering involves not only distinguishing between the  external/internal origin of the information, but also  between  the  different  sources,  either  external  (e Johns Hopkins University, on 13 Oct 2016 at 08:43:36, subject to the Cambridge Core terms of use, available at http:/www Regarding information on feelings, there was a  distinction between the affective quality itself and its  intensity  both at the time of the event and at the time  of the memory To  confirm  some  of  the  source  monitoring  model  assumptions, the authors developed an instrument that  measures the characteristics of memories  the Memory  Characteristics Questionnaire or MCQ According  to  the  reality  monitoring  model  and  various related empirical findings, compared to imag- ined events, perceived events typically have more con- textual, sensory and semantic information (Johnson &  Raye, 1981), affective information (thoughts and feelings)  (Hashtroudi,  Johnson,  &  Chrosniak,  1990;  Johnson   et al The MCQ data used to test  the  psychometric  properties  was  obtained  from  an  experimental study simulating a forensic context in  which two groups of participants were compared sim- ilarly to Suengas and Johnsons (1988) study In each group,  an independent principal component factor analysis of  the questionnaire measures showed that their structure  was similar and matched the five factors mentioned  above The psychometric analysis of the orig- inal MCQ (Suengas & Johnson, 1988) has shown there  are five factors that distinguish memories of perceived  events from memories of imagined ones: (1) Clarity  (visual detail, vividness, event detail, comprehensibility  of the order of events, and overall memories of the  event);  (2)  Sensory  information  (sound,  smell,  and  taste); (3) Contextual information (memory of location,  spatial arrangement of objects, and spatial arrange- ment of people); (4) Thoughts and feelings (memory of  thoughts, memory of feelings, and how much the event  reveals  about  oneself);  and  (5)  Intensity  of  feelings  (how intense they were at the time of the event and  how intense they are while remembering) Also, a two-factor ANOVA  (video clip x condition) was performed to analyze experimental data
