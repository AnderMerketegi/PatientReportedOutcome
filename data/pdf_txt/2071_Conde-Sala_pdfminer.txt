Abstract.This study aimed to determine the factors that predict anosognosia in patients with Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and
to examine the effect of anosognosia on patient and caregiver perceptions of the patient’s quality of life (QoL-p), using a
cross-sectional design with 164 patients and their caregivers. Instruments of measurement included Anosognosia Questionnaire-
Dementia, Geriatric Depression Scale, Quality of Life in AD (QoL-AD), Disability Assessment for Dementia, Neuropsychiatric
Inventory, and the Global Deterioration Scale (GDS). A binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the factors
that predict anosognosia, while a linear regression analysis was conducted to determine the factors associated with QoL-AD.
The degree of anosognosia increased in line with GDS stage (F (2,161) = 41.3, p < 0.001). In the binary regression analysis, the
variables that predicted anosognosia were more neuropsychiatric symptoms (OR = 1.11, 95% CI: 1.06–1.17, p < 0.001), deﬁcits
in ADL (OR = 0.88, 95% CI: 0.83–0.94, p < 0.001), less depression (OR = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.54–0.82, p < 0.001), and older age
(OR = 1.08, 95% CI: 1.00–1.15, p = 0.027). With regards to QoL-p, the multiple linear regression analysis for patients (r2 = 0.486)
showed that less depression ((cid:1) = −0.52, p < 0.001) and greater anosognosia ((cid:1) = 0.40, p < 0.001) explained 33% and 10% of
the variance in QoL-AD, respectively. Greater anosognosia was associated with better perceived QoL-p, especially in advanced
GDS stages. Anosognosia was associated with greater caregiver burden and a greater discrepancy between patient and caregiver
ratings of QoL-p.

The concept of anosognosia refers to a lack of aware-
ness regarding the difﬁculties or deﬁcits associated
with an illness, and it has long been recognized as
an important feature of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) [1].

Speciﬁcally, the person with AD may show a lack of
awareness regarding impairments related to activities
of daily living (ADL) [2] or their neuropsychological
deﬁcits, especially memory [3, 4]. Anosognosia can
have important implications as patients underestimate
their limitations in relation to quality of life [5–7] and
are more prone to engage in dangerous behaviors [8].
It can also lead to increased caregiver burden [9].

Estimates of the prevalence of anosognosia in AD
vary widely between 20% [10] and 80% [11] and
illustrates the enormous complexity and heterogene-
ity of the condition [12–15]. A key contributor to
this variability is the wide range of methods used to
measure anosognosia, which include the use of ques-
tionnaires to compare patient and caregiver ratings
[10], the clinical judgment of professionals in relation
to an anosognosia scale [11], and the administration of
neuropsychological tests [3].

One key question is whether anosognosia forms part
of the general characteristics of the disease process or
whether it is a speciﬁc syndrome that is more common
in certain patients. Although the majority of studies
consider that anosognosia increases in line with the
severity of dementia [4, 15–20], this is not always the
case [21–23]. A similar discrepancy has been observed
in relation to scores on the Mini-Mental State Exam-
ination (MMSE), which some studies have found to
be negatively correlated with anosognosia [3, 10, 18],
while others have failed to conﬁrm such a relationship
[21, 22, 24].

With regards to the hypothesis of speciﬁcity in
relation to anosognosia, various studies have associ-
ated it with speciﬁc neurological changes, such as
an increased density of amyloid plaques in the pro-
subiculum [25], or with frontal lobe dysfunction and
the related behavioral problems [21, 24, 26–29]. From
this perspective, anosognosia would be a more com-
mon symptom of frontotemporal dementia than of AD
[30].

These two domains of anosognosia, that is, related
to cognitive deﬁcits and to behavioral problems,
were analyzed by Starkstein et al. [31], who con-
sidered that they might constitute two independent
phenomena in the context of AD. Anosognosia of cog-
nitive/functional deﬁcits was found to be related to
the severity of dementia, whereas an unawareness of
behavior problems appeared to form part of a disinhi-
bition syndrome.

The ﬁndings are more consistent in relation to the
symptoms associated with the anosognosia. Patients
with anosognosia present deﬁcits in ADL [2–4, 10]
and a greater number of behavioral and psychological

symptoms of dementia (BPSD) [32] such as disin-
hibition [4, 18, 27], apathy [28, 33], irritability and
anxiety [4, 10, 16], agitation [20, 28], and aberrant
motor behavior [28].

A number of aspects merit particular mention. One is
the relationship between depression and anosognosia.
Although some authors have found a negative correla-
tion between the two [11, 17, 18, 20], others have failed
to conﬁrm this [21, 22, 28, 34]. Migliorelli et al. [35]
reported a negative correlation between dysthymia and
anosognosia in the early stages of AD, and suggested
that this was an emotional reaction to the awareness of
cognitive impairment.

A further aspect to consider is the relationship
between anosognosia and patient and caregiver per-
ceptions of the patient’s quality of life (QoL-p). Some
previous studies have reported an association between
anosognosia and a better rating of QoL-p in patients
with moderate dementia [7], but this was not the case
for those with mild dementia [7, 36]. The level of agree-
ment between patient and caregiver ratings of QoL-p
has also been shown to be inﬂuenced by anosognosia
[5, 6, 36].

In relation to these aspects, the present study seeks
to clarify which factors are predictive of and asso-
ciated with anosognosia, to examine the reasons for
the discrepancies in the literature with regards to
depression and anosognosia, and to determine the role
played by anosognosia with respect to the discrep-
ancies between patient and caregiver ratings of the
QoL-p. Speciﬁcally, the aims were: 1) to identify the
clinical and socio-demographic factors associated with
the presence/absence of anosognosia and the factors
that predict it; and 2) to examine how the presence
of anosognosia affects patient and caregiver ratings of
QoL-p.

MATERIALS AND METHODS

Design and study population

This observational, cross-sectional, and analytic
study included a consecutive sample of out-patients
seen at the Dementia Unit of the Department of Neu-
rology at Bellvitge University Hospital (Hospitalet de
Llobregat, Barcelona) and diagnosed as either AD
according to DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Man-
ual of Mental Disorders) criteria [37] or probable
AD according to NINCDS-ADRDA (National Insti-
tute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders
and Stroke/Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders

Associations) criteria [38], and who had a score on the
MMSE [39] of between 10 and 28, thereby enabling
the QoL scale to be applied [40, 41]. The sample also
comprised their respective caregivers, with the main
caregiver being deﬁned as the person who was contin-
uously responsible for helping the patient with ADL.
Patients were excluded if they presented vascular or
traumatic events, alcohol or substance dependency or
abuse, and if they had severe communication problems
that prevented them from responding adequately to the
assessment questions. The study was approved by the
hospital’s Clinical Research Ethics Committee.

Instruments

Clinical and socio-demographic data

Socio-demographic data for patients (age, gender,
schooling, months since diagnosis) were gathered
using an ad hoc structured questionnaire.

Anosognosia

The Anosognosia Questionnaire-Dementia (AQ-D)
[10, 17] was administered to patients and caregivers.
It comprises 30 items that refer to cognitive/functional
deﬁcits and personality changes, with each item being
rated according to the frequency of occurrence, from 0
(never) to 3 (always). The total score therefore ranges
from 0 to 90, with higher scores indicating greater
anosognosia. The ﬁnal score is obtained by calculating
the difference between caregiver and patient scores. In
the original scale validation, its authors considered that
severe anosognosia was present when this difference
is ≥32.

Depression in the patient

The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-d), in its 15-
item format [42], was administered directly to patients.
The cut-off score for probable depression is 6, while
that for deﬁnite depression is 10.

Quality of life

The Quality of Life-Alzheimer’s Disease (QoL-AD)
scale [40] is designed to assess QoL-p from both the
patient’s and the caregiver’s perspective. It comprises
13 items that refer to different aspects of the patient’s
wellbeing. Scores for each item range from 1 (poor)
to 4 (excellent), yielding a total score between 13 and
52 (the higher the score the better the QoL-p). The
scale’s authors considered that it was valid for patients
with MMSE scores >10. In the present study both the
patient and caregiver perspectives were assessed.

Cognitive assessment of the patient

This was based on the MMSE [39], a brief cognitive
assessment tool whose score ranges from 0 to 30 (the
lower the score the greater the cognitive deterioration).
This is the most widely used screening tool for detect-
ing cognitive impairment in AD and it shows close
correspondence to the different stages of deterioration
in the disease [43]. MMSE scores were corrected for
age and education [44].

Functional assessment of the patient

The Disability Assessment for Dementia (DAD)
[45], a measure of basic and instrumental ADL, was
administered to caregivers. The DAD comprises 40
items and its total score ranges from 40 to 80 (the higher
the score the greater functional capacity).

Behavioral and psychological symptoms of
dementia

This aspect was evaluated by means of the Neu-
ropsychiatric Inventory (NPI) [46], which comprises
twelve subscales that assess the frequency and severity
of twelve neuropsychiatric symptoms, based on infor-
mation provided by caregivers. Scores range from 0 to
144, and the higher the score the greater the frequency
and severity of neuropsychiatric symptoms.

Stage of dementia

This was based on the criteria of the Global Deterio-
ration Scale (GDS), a clinical assessment tool designed
to determine the stage of a patient’s dementia [47].
GDS 4 corresponds to cases of mild dementia, GDS 5
to moderate dementia, and GDS 6 to moderately severe
dementia.

Caregiver burden

This was assessed using the Zarit Burden Interview
(ZBI) [48], which comprises 22 items that are scored
on a Likert scale ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (almost
always). The total score therefore ranges between 22
and 110 (the higher the score the greater the burden).

Procedure

The neurologists from the Dementia Unit identiﬁed
eligible patients according to the inclusion criteria and
determined their stage of dementia on the GDS scale
[47]. The sample was recruited between January and
October 2011. Of the total number of patients who
met the inclusion criteria, only four families declined
to participate.

Prior to the initial assessment interview at Bellvitge
the aims of the study were

explained to patients and caregivers, and informed con-
sent was obtained from all participants. Patients and
their caregivers were then interviewed separately by
two psychologists trained in the administration of the
respective tests ands instruments.

Statistical analysis

A descriptive analysis was carried out of the clinical
and socio-demographic characteristics of the sample,
using absolute and relative frequencies for qualitative
variables and measures of central trend and dispersion
for quantitative variables.

Based on their score on the AQ-D patients were
assigned to one of two groups, no or mild anosognosia
(NM-AN) and severe anosognosia (S-AN), using the
cut-off (≥32) suggested by the scale’s authors [9, 15].
In order to optimize the utility and clinical interest of
the results, patients without anosognosia (≤14 AQ-D)
and those with mild anosognosia (14–32 AQ-D) were
grouped together, as the analysis of associated factors
revealed no signiﬁcant differences between these two
subgroups.

Differences between the two groups (NM-AN and
S-AN) in relation to qualitative clinical and socio-
demographic variables were analyzed by means of
the chi-squared test. Quantitative variables were ana-
lyzed by means of parametric or non-parametric tests,
in accordance with criteria of normality. When there
was a signiﬁcant difference between two measures
Cohen’s d was calculated in order to determine the
effect size. The degree of bivariate association between
AQ-D scores and the clinical factors of patients was
determined by calculating global correlations in each
of the two groups, according to criteria of normality
(rs = Spearman, r = Pearson).

Predictive factors related to the dichotomous vari-
able (NM-AN versus S-AN) were identiﬁed by means
of a binary logistic regression analysis, using the Enter
method (all variables in a single step) for global fac-
tors and the forward Wald method for disaggregated
factors (NPI & DAD).

The relevance of the factors associated with anosog-
nosia was evaluated by multiple linear regression
analysis, using AQ-D score as the dependent variable
and considering both global data and data disag-
gregated by GDS stage. Finally, two multiple linear
regression analyses were ﬁtted to the sample data as a
whole using QoL-AD scores as the dependent vari-
able, the purpose being to identify the inﬂuence of
the various factors on QoL, according to both patient
and caregiver perceptions. This was done using the

Enter method (all variables in a single step) for global
factors. In the multiple linear regression analysis, the
coefﬁcient of contribution for each variable was calcu-
lated by means of the solution suggested by Guilford
and Fruchter [49]: beta coefﬁcient x the coefﬁcient of
correlation with the dependent variable.

For hypothesis contrasts, the level of statistical sig-
niﬁcance was set at 0.05. All data processing and
analysis was performed using SPSS version 17.0 for
Windows.

RESULTS

Description of the sample

The ﬁnal study sample comprised 164 patients.
Twenty ﬁve of the initial cases (n = 189) were excluded:
in 14 cases only the family caregiver could be
interviewed, in one case only the patient could be inter-
viewed, and in ten cases the patient had an MMSE score
below 10.

The mean age of patients was 77.6 ± 7.2 years; 96
(58.5%) of them were women and 98 (59.7%) had
received fewer than ﬁve years of schooling.

The mean MMSE score was 17.9 ± 5.8. With
regards to the severity of dementia, 71 patients (43.3%)
met the criteria for GDS stage 4, 52 patients (31.7%)
the criteria for GDS stage 5, and 41 patients (25.0%)

36.3 ± 18.9, with 95 patients (57.9%; CI: 50.0–65.7)
scoring ≥32 on this scale. The clinical and socio-
demographic data are shown in Table 1.

Factors associated with anosognosia

The associated factors were compared across the
two groups: NM-AN (n = 69) and S-AN (n = 95). In
the bivariate analysis, patients with S-AN were older,
scored lower on the MMSE, had more deﬁcits in ADL,
more symptoms on the NPI (agitation, apathy, dis-
inhibition, irritability, aberrant motor behavior, and
appetite disorders), a more advanced GDS stage, and
had been diagnosed for longer. There were no signiﬁ-
cant differences related to gender or years of schooling
(Table 2).

The correlations between AQ-D scores and ADL
were signiﬁcant in both groups, with the relationship
instrumental ADL (NM-AN,
being stronger
rs = –0.42, p < 0.001; S-AN, rs = –0.40, p < 0.001). The

for

greatest differences between the two patient groups
were observed in the correlations with the NPI.
Whereas in the NM-AN group, there was only a
weakly signiﬁcant correlation with euphoria (rs = 0.24,
p = 0.045), the S-AN group showed signiﬁcant correla-
tions between the AQ-D and several neuropsychiatric
symptoms: agitation (rs = 0.24, p = 0.045), eupho-
ria (rs = 0.29, p = 0.003), disinhibition (rs = 0.34,
irritability (rs = 0.32, p = 0.002), aber-
p = 0.001),
(rs = 0.29, p = 0.003), and
rant motor behavior
appetite/weight changes (rs = 0.29, p = 0.004). Depres-
sion scores on the GDS-d were signiﬁcantly and
inversely correlated with the AQ-D when analyzing the
total sample (rs = −0.27, p < 0.001). The complete cor-
relational results can be consulted in the Supplemen-
tary Table 1 (available online: http://www.j-alz.com/
issues/33/vol33-4.html#supplementarydata06).

The cognitive/functional subscale of the AQ-D
showed a weakly signiﬁcant correlation with MMSE
scores (rs = −0.28, p < 0.001) and a strongly signiﬁ-
cant correlation with the DAD (rs = −0.67, p < 0.001).

the NPI. The correlation between the GDS-d and NPI-
depression was weak, although it was positive for the
sample as a whole (rs = 0.23, p = 0.002).

Factors predictive of anosognosia

In the binary logistic regression model, the factors
that predicted the presence of S-AN were a greater
frequency and severity of BPSD (NPI), less depression
(GDS-d), poorer functional ability (DAD), and older
age. The MMSE score was not signiﬁcant due to its
high collinearity with the DAD, although the MMSE
did become a signiﬁcant predictor (OR = 0.90, 95%
CI: 0.83–0.97, p = 0.010) when the DAD was removed
from the regression analysis.

The regression analysis applied to the disaggregated
factors of the NPI and DAD showed that deﬁcits in
instrumental ADL (DAD), less depression (GDS-d),
NPI-irritability, and NPI-disinhibition were all signif-
icant (Table 3). Scores on the NPI subscales agitation,
apathy, aberrant motor behavior, and appetite disorders
were not predictive of anosognosia.

The behavioral subscale of the AQ-D showed a strong
correlation with the NPI (rs = 0.63, p < 0.001).

Regarding depression, patients in the NM-AN group
scored higher when they were assessed directly with

patients. Similarly, the percentage of patients with
S-AN increased as the dementia became more severe
(GDS 4 = 30.9%; GDS 5 = 71.1%; GDS 6 = 87.8%)
(Table 4A).

In the bivariate analysis of GDS stages, the differ-
ences between the NM-AN and S-AN groups with
respect to apathy, aberrant motor behavior, and appetite
disorders were only signiﬁcant in the early stages of
the disease. The only factors that remained signiﬁcant
across all the stages were disinhibition, irritability, and
agitation (Supplementary Table 2).

In the linear regression analysis conducted accord-
ing to GDS stage, the greatest number of relevant
factors associated with the presence of S-AN was
observed in relation to GDS stage 4 (deﬁcits in ADL,
neuropsychiatric symptoms, and less depression). As
the severity of dementia increased,
these factors
became less relevant, such that the only factor that
showed a signiﬁcant association across all GDS stages
was neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPI) (Table 4B).

The patient’s quality of life and anosognosia

Patients

In the bivariate analysis, perceived QoL-p differed
signiﬁcantly between patients with S-AN and those
with NM-AN, with the former giving higher ratings
on the QoL-AD scale (Table 2). In the analysis by
GDS stage, there were no signiﬁcant differences in
scores on the QoL-AD when considering the sample
as a whole. However, when the two groups were ana-
lyzed separately, the score on the QoL-AD decreased
signiﬁcantly among NM-AN patients as their dementia
became more severe, while there were no differences
in S-AN patients. Scores on the QoL-AD were always
lower among NM-AN patients than among those in the
S-AN group, and this difference became more marked
with increasing severity of dementia, reaching signiﬁ-
cance at GDS stages 5 and 6 (Table 5A).

In the linear regression analysis, higher scores for
perceived QoL-p were associated with less depres-

1112

sion, greater anosognosia, better ability in relation to
instrumental ADL, and fewer neuropsychiatric symp-
toms. Depression and anosognosia were the main
explanatory variables, accounting respectively for
33.1% and 10.0% of the variance in QoL-AD scores
(Table 5B).

Caregivers

In the bivariate analysis, caregiver ratings of QoL-
p were higher for NM-AN patients than for those in
the S-AN group (Table 2). In the analysis by GDS
stage, ratings of QoL-p became worse as the sever-
ity of dementia increased, this being the case for both
groups (NM-AN and S-AN), although the difference
between the two was only signiﬁcant at GDS stages
4 and 5 (Table 5A). Caregiver burden (ZBI) only
showed signiﬁcant correlations at these two stages,
speciﬁcally with ratings of QoL-p (GDS 4, rs = –0.59,
p < 0.001; GDS 5, rs = −0.38, p = 0.005) and scores
on the AQ-D (GDS 4, rs = 0.44, p < 0.001; GDS 5,
rs = 0.29, p = 0.033).

In the linear regression analysis, higher ratings of
QoL-p were associated with better functional ability,
less anosognosia, less depression, and fewer neuropsy-
chiatric symptoms. Anosognosia and functional ability
explained, respectively, 17.6% and 23.3% of the vari-
ance in QoL-AD scores (Table 5B).

Differences between patients and caregivers

The bivariate analysis showed that for both groups of
patients (Table 2) and all GDS stages (Table 5A), care-
giver ratings were always worse than those of patients.
A linear regression analysis with the difference in QoL-
AD scores (patients – caregivers) as the dependent
variable (r2 = 0.468) revealed that anosognosia was
the main variable ((cid:1) = 0.54, p < 0.001, r = 0.64) asso-
ciated with differences in patient and caregiver ratings
of QoL, it accounting for 34.6% of the variance.

DISCUSSION

Factors predictive of anosognosia

The ﬁrst objective of this study was to identify fac-
tors that predict anosognosia. The analysis showed that
the most relevant variables in this regard were more
symptoms on the NPI, less depression (GDS-d), and
greater deﬁcits in ADL. In line with previous research,
the most important neuropsychiatric symptoms were
found to be greater disinhibition [4, 18, 27] and irri-
tability [4, 10, 16]. The signiﬁcant association between

deﬁcits in ADL and anosognosia has also been reported
previously [2–4, 10]. Overall, apathy was not a predic-
tor of anosognosia, consistent with a speciﬁc study on
this aspect [33]. In line with other previous ﬁndings
[28, 50], apathy was correlated with anosognosia in our
patients with mild dementia. However, this correlation
was not maintained among patients with moderate or
severe dementia. These results suggest that apathy is
a disorder that increases in line with the severity of
dementia regardless of the presence of anosognosia,
and it may be considered a predictor of functional
deterioration, especially regarding basic ADL [51].

Anosognosia and severity of dementia: Associated
and speciﬁc factors

Scores on the AQ-D increased in line with the sever-
ity of dementia (GDS) in both NM-AN and S-AN
patients, although more notably in the former. These
results are consistent with previous ﬁndings regarding
the relationship between the degree of anosognosia and
severity of dementia [4, 16–20]. Some authors have,
however, questioned these ﬁndings due to the lack of
a signiﬁcant correlation with the MMSE [21–24] or
because they consider that the most signiﬁcant aspect
is frontal lobe dysfunction [21, 24] or behavioral prob-
lems [23], rather than the severity of dementia. In the
present study, the MMSE also appeared as a predictive
variable in the binary logistic regression analysis when
the DAD variable was removed, with a high degree of
collinearity between the two.

A further aspect is the difﬁculty of differentiating
among disorders associated with anosognosia or with
the severity of dementia. Although anosognosia does
increase in line with the severity of dementia, this is
also the case of other problems such as apathy, appetite
disorders, and aberrant motor behavior. Differences
between the NM-AN and S-AN groups with regard to
these disorders were only present at the early stage of
dementia, the distinction being lost in more advanced
patients. This suggests that these disorders are more
related to the stage of dementia than to anosognosia,
and at all events they would only be associated with
anosognosia in early-stage patients. This conclusion is
supported by the results of a previous study that found
a positive correlation between anosognosia and apathy,
agitation, and aberrant motor behavior in patients with
mild AD [28].

Disinhibition,

irritability, and agitation seem to
be more speciﬁcally associated with anosognosia
as they were more common among patients in the
S-AN group, including at advanced stages. Similarly,

J.L. Conde-Sala et al. / Anosognosia and Quality of Life

1113

in the linear regression analysis, the only variable
that remained signiﬁcant across all stages was neu-
ropsychiatric symptoms (NPI). These data suggest that
greater anosognosia is associated with greater severity
of dementia, although this relationship is more notable
in patients with more BPSD, who probably present
more frontal lobe dysfunctions [21, 24].

Depression and anosognosia

All the analyses of the present study reveal an inverse
correlation between depression (assessed by the GDS-
d) and anosognosia, a ﬁnding consistent with a number
of previous studies [11, 17, 18, 20, 35]. However, not
all authors have found this relationship [21, 22, 28,
34]. This discrepancy may be due to a methodological
problem. Whereas the former set of authors applied
instruments directly to the patient, the latter assessed
depression according to DSM-IV criteria for major
depression [21, 34], using either the items from the
AQ-D [22] or the NPI-Depression subscale [28].

Assessing depression in the patient directly during
the early stages of dementia enables reliable infor-
mation to be obtained, whereas it is possible than in
more advanced stages, the patient’s mood will also be
affected by anosognosia. Our data support the hypoth-
esis of those authors who found a negative correlation
between anosognosia and depression, namely that a
greater awareness of deﬁcits (less anosognosia) is
related to a reactive depressive mood, especially in the
early stages of dementia.

The patient’s quality of life and anosognosia

The second objective of this study was to examine
the relationship between anosognosia and patient and
caregiver ratings of the QoL-p. In line with previous
research [7, 36], we found that in cases of mild AD
(GDS stage 4), anosognosia did not produce differ-
ences in the perception of patients. Overall, patients
with S-AN gave higher ratings of QoL, whereas those
in the NM-AN group rated QoL as worse. This shows
that a greater awareness of deﬁcits and difﬁculties (less
anosognosia) is related to a poorer perception of QoL,
and highlights the relevance of psychological factors in
the early stages of the disease (lower QoL-AD scores
associated with greater depression and less anosog-
nosia). Conversely, in more advanced stages biological
factors would acquire greater importance (higher QoL-
AD scores associated with more anosognosia).

Caregiver ratings of QoL-p were lower as the
severity of dementia increased, although the greatest

differences related to anosognosia were observed in
the early stages of the disease. These results could be
related to the fact that caregiver burden [9] is more
strongly correlated with QoL-p and AQ-D scores in
the early stages, due to the greater initial impact of the
disease.

Anosognosia was the most important variable in
terms of explaining the differences between patient and
caregiver ratings of QoL-p. Greater anosognosia was
related to better perceived QoL-p among patients and to
poorer ratings by caregivers. These data call into ques-
tion the perception of QoL-p reported by patients with
S-AN, especially in the advanced stages of dementia.
This is consistent with the ﬁndings of various authors
who consider that in patients with anosognosia the
ratings of QoL-p are better [7, 36], less reliable, and
should be interpreted with caution [5, 6].

In terms of objective criteria of impairment, care-
giver ratings would seem to offer a better reﬂection
of reality. Subjectively, however, the differing percep-
tions of patients and caregivers may represent two
potentially valid perspectives [6, 12], although further
research would be required to conﬁrm this hypothesis.

CONCLUSIONS

This study makes two main contributions. Firstly,
it identiﬁes the functional deﬁcits (neuropsychiatric
symptoms) that are associated with greater anosog-
nosia, highlighting instrumental ADL, disinhibition,
and irritability as predictive factors. Less depression,
assessed directly in the patients, was also a relevant
predictor of anosognosia. Secondly, the study demon-
strates that anosognosia is the most important factor
in relation to the discrepancies between patient and
caregiver ratings of the QoL-p. Patients with greater
anosognosia rate their QoL as higher, this being par-
ticularly so in the advanced stages of dementia. Among
caregivers, by contrast, greater anosognosia is associ-
ated with poorer ratings of the QoL-p, especially in
the early stages of the disease, where it is strongly
correlated with caregiver burden.

Clinical implications

Patients without anosognosia present more depres-
sion, while less depression is shown to be the most
important factor in terms of better perceived QoL-p.
Consequently, depression should be regarded as a key
factor in the treatment of patients with AD.

1114

J.L. Conde-Sala et al. / Anosognosia and Quality of Life

Behavioral symptoms are an important factor in
patients with anosognosia. This is a more complicated
issue as such symptoms form an intrinsic part of the
disease, this being more notable among patients with
anosognosia. A reduction in neuropsychiatric symp-
toms would lead to increased wellbeing in the patient
and, especially, in family caregivers.

Patients’ own ratings of their QoL should be accom-
panied by measures of depression and anosognosia.
Whereas depression could lead to a more negative
perception the presence of anosognosia could lead to
overly positive ratings of QoL by the patient, hence the
need for complementary measures.

Among caregivers, interventions that enable them
to develop a better understanding of the nature of
dementia, to maintain signiﬁcant relationships with the
patient [12], and which provide ongoing educational
and emotional support to reduce burden could help
them to have a more positive view of QoL-p [52, 53].

Limitations and future directions

The present research opted for a global study of
anosognosia so as to analyze the clinical factors asso-
ciated with it and to examine its effect on patient
and caregiver ratings of the QoL-p. The study of how
anosognosia affects the different neuropsychological
domains (memory, language, executive functions, etc.)
would require both a more homogeneous sample in
relation to MMSE scores, as well as the use of spe-
ciﬁc tests to assess these domains. These aspects need
to be addressed in future research. The controversial
issue of depression and anosognosia could be analyzed
in future studies in relation to the speciﬁc criteria of
depression in AD [54].

Another key limitation of the present study is that it
lacks a longitudinal perspective which would provide
greater clarity regarding the factors associated with
both anosognosia and QoL-p as dementia becomes
more severe. Finally, it is acknowledged that the study
did not consider, in detail, the potential inﬂuence of
caregiver factors such as gender, burden, and men-
tal health on the appraisal of anosognosia and QoL-p.
Future studies should therefore analyze caregiver fac-
tors in relation to the latter two aspects.
